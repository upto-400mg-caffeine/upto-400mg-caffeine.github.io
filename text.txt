1. Introduce yourself and your background. 

*"Thanks for having me. My name is , and I’m currently a PhD student in Business Administration with a focus on Computer Information Systems at University. 

I’ve been studying and working in the IS field for quite a while. I have two master’s degrees—one in Information Systems from the University of Memphis and another in Management Information Systems from Kookmin University. Over the years, I’ve done research on topics like trust in AI, cybersecurity, and IT adoption, and I’ve had my work published in journals like The Data Base for Advances in Information Systems and conferences like HICSS. 

Besides research, I’ve worked as a researcher at Kookmin University and the University of Arkansas, where I applied data science techniques to consumer behavior research. I’ve also managed IT infrastructure, handled data analytics, and worked on various research projects, which have given me a strong mix of academic and practical experience."* 

 

2. Why are you interested in the IS field, and do you have any professional experience relevant to the PhD program? 

*"I got into Information Systems because I’ve always been curious about how technology changes the way businesses and people make decisions. What really interests me is how companies build trust in digital systems, how they transition between different IT infrastructures, and how cybersecurity plays a role in that process. 

On the professional side, I’ve had hands-on experience in IT management, data analytics, and project management. For example, at Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corp., I evaluated the quality of open government data and how it could be shared with third parties. I also managed IT infrastructure at GMS, where I got to see how companies handle digital transformation firsthand. 

These experiences have helped me see both the technical and managerial sides of IS, and they’ve given me a solid foundation for my PhD research."* 

 

3. Why did you choose the UNT program? Why did you switch to UNT? 

*"I chose UNT because it’s a great fit for my research interests and career goals. The IS program here has a strong reputation, and I was especially drawn to the faculty and the research culture. 

One of the main reasons I decided to transfer to UNT is the opportunity to work with top researchers in my field. I wanted to be in an environment where I could collaborate with faculty who specialize in IT adoption, cybersecurity, and digital trust—areas that align perfectly with my research. Also, UNT’s strong focus on interdisciplinary research and industry connections makes it an ideal place to develop my expertise and grow as a researcher."* 

 

4. Do you have any specific research interests and faculty members at UNT you want to work with? 

*"Yes, I do. My main research interest is understanding why organizations shift from cloud-based systems back to on-premises solutions. This has big implications for IT governance, cybersecurity, and digital transformation strategies. 

I’m particularly interested in working with Professor Dan J. Kim because his research on cybersecurity, digital trust, and AI-driven systems aligns closely with what I want to study. His work provides a strong theoretical foundation that I’d like to build on. I’m also looking forward to collaborating with other faculty members who specialize in IT adoption and enterprise system transitions. 

Beyond faculty mentorship, I’m excited about the research community at UNT and the chance to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that can push my research even further."* 

 

5. What are you planning to do after completing your PhD? 

*"After my PhD, I see myself pursuing a career in academia. I want to become a professor at a research-focused university where I can continue working on IT adoption, cybersecurity, and digital transformation. Teaching is also something I’m passionate about, and I’d love to guide students in exploring these areas. 

At the same time, I’m open to industry collaborations, especially in consulting or research-driven roles where I can apply my expertise to real-world problems. My goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation, making sure my work has both theoretical and real-world impact."* 

 

6. Do you have any questions for our program and faculty? 

*"Yes, I have a few. 

I’d love to hear more about the current research initiatives in the IS department, especially those related to IT adoption, cybersecurity, and digital trust. Are there any ongoing projects that align with these areas? 

How does the program encourage interdisciplinary collaboration? Are there opportunities to work with faculty from other departments like data science or business analytics? 

I’d also like to know more about how PhD students are supported in terms of research development, publishing in top journals, and career placement after graduation."*
